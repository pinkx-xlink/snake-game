This game was created by following the tutorial at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-snake-game-in-javascript/

I followed this tutorial as a warm to The Odin Project JavaScript Course: Knights Travails Project. It's been several months since I've made a "gameboard" type of project with JavaScript and want to re-familiarize myself with the layout and how to tackle a project that uses a board.
